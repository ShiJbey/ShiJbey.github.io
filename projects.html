                I started this project in 2016 as an effort to learn more
                about procedural content generation and computer graphics.
                The then-upcoming release of 'No Man's Sky' and my interest
                in blacksmithing inspired me to pursue this.  My goal was
                to submit it to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/">/r/proceduralgeneration</a>
                subreddit challenge linked below. Since then, I have continuously
                tinkered with this project in my free time.  Infiniforge is a
                NodeJs server that exports 3D meshes (using ThreeJs) as glTF
                JSON via a REST API. After exporting the models, they can then
                be imported into Unity or any other software that supports the
                glTF format.

                This was the final project for my Fall 2018 15-466: Computer Game Programming course. I worked on a team with three other students where my primary role was to write the code which imported our 3D assets, built the level, and instanced characters/animations. In the game, you play a Magpie bird who is stealing items from a museum. How many items can you steal before you're caught by security?

            <p>
                Inspired by my enjoyment of raids in games like Destiny, I started working on this project during my free time. The goal is to train AI agents to work as a team to defeat a boss character in an MMORPG-style Raid battle. This project is my first exploration into cooperative multiagent machine learning (MARL). There are two components to this project that interest me the most. The first is teaching the team of agents to cooperate based on their role on the team (RPG class). The second is teaching the large boss character to attack enemies and efficiently defend themselves from multiple attackers. I think raids are ideal environments for teaching intelligent agents cooperation and role-playing skills. I see MMORPGs taking advantage of a system like this to produce better companion AI. Currently, this project is very much a work in progress as I am still designing the environment. If this project proves successful, I would like to expand the results to a published game.

            <p>
                This was my masters research project. The goal was to explore the use of an auditory P300 BCI paradigm for enabling users to select objects in virtual reality. What I ended with was an EEG-hardware agnostic Unity project that could be configured to run different P300 paradigms in virtual reality. The while running the unity scene EEG data is streamed from the headset and written out to files to be processed. For example, one can take recorded EEG data using a machine learning classifier to make predictions as to what object the user wants to select. Pictured is the virtual apartment environment with three objects used during testing.

            I threw this project together over the course of a week as an entry
            in Unity's first challenge for their new 'Ml-Agents' machine learning
            workflow. I had tossed around the idea of using machine learning to
            train AI agents in fighting games, but I had never gotten around to
            it until then. The agents learn via Reinforcement Learning and are
            given a simple policy that positively rewards landed punches on the
            opponent, and negatively awards taking damage. Other behaviors such
            as successful blocking, and advancing on the opponent are rewarded
            as well.

                This was the first class project from my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course.  All groups were asked to produce a clone of the popular 'Plants vs. Zombies' game. This project was both a lesson in game development as well as a lesson in handling group dynamics. The game is written in Racket.

                This game clone was the final group project in my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course. Out of the possible games to create, my group chose to go with Battleship. The game was written using Racket and allows one player to play against an AI. Core lessons learned during this project included coordinating another student and programming GUIs in Racket.
