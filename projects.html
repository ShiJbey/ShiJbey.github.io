            <p class="projectDescription">
            Inspired by the then upcoming release of 'No Man's Sky' and my interest in blacksmithing,
            I started this project. My goal was to finish and submit it to the Reddit PCG challenge linked below.
            Since then, I have been continuously tinkering with this project in my free time.
            This project served as my introduction to both procedurcal content generation as well as computer graphics.
            The result is a NodeJs server that exports 3D meshes (ThreeJs) as glTF JSON via a REST API. These
            glTF models can be imported into Unity and other software that support the format.

            <img id="audioErpScreenshot" src="./Assets/vr-screenshot.png" alt="audio erp screenshot">

            <p class="projectDescription">
            This was my masters research project. The goal was to explore the use of an auditory P300
            BCI paradigm for enabling users to select objects in virtual reality. What I ended with was
            an EEG-hardware agnostic Unity project that could be configured to run different P300 paradigms
            in virtual reality. The while runnning the unity scene EEG data is streamed from the headset
            and written out to files to be processed. For example, one is able to take recorded EEG data
            use a machine learning classifier to make predictions as to what object the user wants to select.
            Pictured is the virtual apartment environment with three objects used during testing.

            This was the final project for my Fall 2018 15-666: Computer Game Programming course. I worked with
            three
            other students and My primary role
            on this project was to write the code which imported our 3D assets, built the level, and instanced
            characters/animations. In the game you play a Magpie bird who is stealing items from a museum.
            How many items can you steal before you're caught by security?

            <img id="mlBoxingScreenshot" src="./Assets/ml-boxing.gif" alt="Ml_boxing gif">
            I threw this project together over the course of a week as an entry in Unity's first challenge
            for their new 'Ml-Agents' machine learning workflow. I had tossed around the idea of
            using machine learning to train AI agents in fighting games, but I had never gotten around to it
            until then. The agents learn via Reinforcement Learning and are given a simple policy that
            positively rewards landed punches on the opponent, and negatively awards taking damage. Other
            behaviors such as successful blocking, and advancing on the opponent are rewarded as well.

            <p class="projectDescription">
            This is the first project from my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course. This was also
            my first
            group development project inwhich I worked with and another student. All groups were asked to produce
            a clone of the popular 'Plants vs. Zombies' game. This project as both a lesson in game development as
            well as
            a lesson in handling group dynamics. The game is written in Racket.

            This game clone was the final group project in my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I"
            course.
            Out of the cloning options, we chose to go with Battleship. The game is written using Racket and allows
            one player to play against an AI. Core lessons learned during the course of this project included,
            coordinating another student and programming GUIs in Racket.
