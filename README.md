# Infiniforge Web
### shijbey.github.io

This readme is for the infiniforge web port. I use this project to prototype features for the NodeJS version of this project.

## Build Instructions
\*** NOTE: I am  currently updating the package.json file to minify the Javascript and convert it to ES5. At the moment, I am using a combination of uglify and babal. This is probably going to change.
