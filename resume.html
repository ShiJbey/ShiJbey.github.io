                I assisted in facilitating students' learning of Java and object-oriented programming/design concepts. As part of my role, I graded students' work, held a weekly office hour, and ran a weekly lab section where students worked on assigned problem sets. Because I really enjoy teaching, I held additional office hours and started conducting 3-hour exam review sessions during midterms and finals. Also, my hard work earned me the privilege of occasionally substituting in for the professor to give course lectures.

                This research was coupled with my Master's research project in which I developed and implemented a virtual reality environment for testing event-related potentials (ERP) paradigms. The goal was to use the system to give users the ability to select and interact with objects in a virtual space. The environment was implemented using Unity and tested using an HTC Vive and a Brain Products EEG cap.

                As my first experience working with electroencephalography (EEG) recording, I learned about various brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms and their practical usage. My project for the summer was to take what I had learned to implement a "P300 speller" application, which would allow users to type text using their recorded brain activity. I implemented my system using a Raspberry Pi 3, OpenBCI EEG board, and Python.

                I worked in with Dr. Ernst Niebur one of his Ph.D. students, on a project to explore the role head movements play in the visual exploration of images and scenes. As the developer on this project,  I implemented and deployed our virtual reality environment on an Andriod smartphone using Unity and the Google Cardboard SDK. This research was conducted in Dr. Niebur's lab in the Mind/Brain Institute at the Johns Hopkins University. 
                I learned about 3D math, VR design, data collection, and research experiment design

                As an intern for the summer, I worked within a team of 5-6 software engineers on an agile-scrum team. My main responsibility was to address software defects critical to release. This included debugging C++ software/PHP extensions written in C++, conducting manual tests, and writing acceptance tests using PHP and FitNesse.
