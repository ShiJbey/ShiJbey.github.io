            <h2>Computational Media Ph.D. Portfolio</h2>


            <p>Hello, UC Santa Cruz Computational Media Ph.D. admissions committee. Thank you for considering my application. On this page, you will find links to project examples that touch on each of the core areas of Computational Media. In my past experiences, most of my work has been technical in nature. However, I have also included a couple of creative projects. Each of the project links will direct you to a blog post where I talk more about the design/development process.  Web demos are available for the Infiniforge and ML-Agent boxing projects. Also, the code for each project is available on GitHub. For my interpretive project examples, I have included links to research publications that resulted from my work at Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate student.</p>

            <h3>Interpretive Projects</h3>
            <p>Below are links to the research publications that resulted from my work at Johns Hopkins University. At the time, I was an undergraduate research intern in Dr.Niebur's Computational Neuroscience lab.  I worked on a project team with a Ph.D. student and another undergraduate. The goal of the project was to investigate what role head movements play in the visual exploration of images in VR. My job was to develop a VR environment that could present images to participants and track/record their head movements. After my job was complete, another undergraduate student was responsible for conducting live-trials.</p>
