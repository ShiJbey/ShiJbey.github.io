    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>I want to develop brain-computer interface technologies that provide sensory
        feedback for virtual reality experiences. VR is becoming a big in 2016 and it will
        continue to be as we move into the future. So far the biggest problem has 
        been finding an interface that fully complements the VR experience. We have touch
        controllers that allow for a higher sense of immersion and interaction with the world,
        but it is still far from feeling real. I want to get our mind involved more in the
        gaming process and take VR immersion to the next level. Following undergraduate study,
        I will be attending graduate school to conduct research on closed-loop haptic brain-machine
        interfaces to help create the next generation of VR.</p>
