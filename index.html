            <p id="bio">
                I earned my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 and my Bachelor of Science from the University of Delaware with a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience.
                <br><br>
                I am interested in the creativity, world-building, and engineering process behind creating immersive and expressive video game experiences. Following this interest, I chose my university majors because I wanted to research and develop hardware that used trans-cranial stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to provide haptic feedback for virtual and mixed reality.
                <br><br>
                During my time at the Army Research Lab, I started working with EEG-based brain-computer interfaces. During my time in graduate school, I continued to work in this area, combining my EEG knowledge with my prior experience developing for virtual reality.
                <br><br>
                While at Carnegie Mellon, I learned more about concepts such as machine learning, probability theory, and computer vision. I also developed an interest in intelligent agents in video games research. Thus, I decided to transition into the field of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems following the completion of my masterâ€™s degree.
                <br><br>
                My educational experience has given me an essential understanding of software engineering principles such as algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and operating systems. It also provided me the opportunity to explore other areas like human cognition, sensation, perception, and physiology. All of which are drawn heavily upon when designing intelligent systems which interact with humans.
                <br><br>
                Below you will find descriptions of current/past projects as well as links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and CV. Enjoy.
