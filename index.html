                I am a graduate student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University working with
                 <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pgrover/">Dr.Pulkit Grover</a>. I earned my Bachelor of
                Science degree from the University of Delaware with a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience. My
                current research focus is on the use of electroencephalography (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in conjuction
                with virtual reality/mixed reality platforms. My personal interests include video games, AI, and machine learning.
                Below you will find descriptions of current and past projects. Enjoy.

                <img id="audioErpScreenshot" src="./Assets/vr-screenshot.png" alt="audio erp screenshot">
                This is my masters research thesis project. The goal is to explore the use of an auditory P300 
                BCI paradigm for enabling users to select objects in virtual reality. Users select objects by 
                focusing on the sound direction associated with the specific object. We are able to take the
                brain response generated by this task and use a machine learning classifier to make predictions 
                as to what object the user wants to select. Pictured are the virtual apartment environment and 
                three objects used during testing.

                <img id="mlBoxingScreenshot" src="./Assets/ml-boxing.gif" alt="Ml_boxing gif">
                I threw this project together over the course of a week as an entry in Unity's first challenge
                for their new 'Ml-Agents' machine learning workflow. I had tossed around the idea of
                using machine learning to train AI agents in fighting games, but had never gotten around to it
                until then. The agents learn via Reinforcement Learning and are given a simple policy that
                positively rewards landed punches on the opponent, and negatively awards taking damage.
                 Other behaviors such as successful blocking, and advancing on the opponent are rewarded
                as well.

                <img id="swordScreenshot" src="./Assets/sword-screenshot.png" alt="Sword Screenshot">
                Inspired by the then upcoming release of 'No Man's Sky' and my interest in blacksmithing,
                I tried my hand at developing a PCG system for swords. My goal was to finish the project 
                and submit it to the Reddit PCG challenge linked below. This project served as an
                introduction to both PCG as well as computer graphics. The result is a NodeJs server that
                can export 3D meshes to Unity via a REST API. I am working on a HTML5 version that people
                can play on this site. The current version (see 'Infiniforge' tab above), is still much under
                construction.

                <img id="pvzScreenshot" src="./Assets/pvz-screenshot.png" alt="PvZ screenshot">
                This is the first project from my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course. This was also my first
                group development project inwhich I worked with and another student. All groups were asked to produce
                a clone of the popular 'Plants vs. Zombies' game. This project as both a lesson in game development as well as
                a lesson in handling group dynamics. The game is written in Racket.

                This game clone was the final group project in  my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course.
                Out of the cloning options, we chose to go with Battleship. The game is written using Racket and allows
                one player to play against an AI. Core lessons learned during the course of this project included,
                coordinating another student and programming GUIs in Racket.
