            <p>University of Delaware CIS Department - Newark, DE</p>
            <p>Feb 2017 - May 2017</p>
            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
              I assisted in facilitating students' learning of Java and object-oriented programming/design concepts. As part of my role, I graded students' work, held a weekly office hour, and ran a weekly lab section where students worked on assigned problem sets. Because I really enjoy teaching, I held additional office hours and started conducting 3-hour exam review sessions during midterms and finals. Also, my hard work earned me the privilege of occasionally substituting in for the professor to give course lectures.

            <p>June 2018 - May 2019</p>
            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
                This research was coupled with my Master's research project in which I developed and implemented a virtual reality environment for testing event-related potentials (ERP) paradigms. The goal was to use the system to give users the ability to select and interact with objects in a virtual space. The environment was implemented using Unity and tested using an HTC Vive and a Brain Products EEG cap.

            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
                As my first experience working with electroencephalography (EEG) recording, I learned about various brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms and their practical usage. My project for the summer was to take what I had learned to implement a "P300 speller" application, which would allow users to type text using their recorded brain activity. I implemented my system using a Raspberry Pi 3, OpenBCI EEG board, and Python.

            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
                I worked in with Dr. Ernst Niebur one of his Ph.D. students, on a project to explore the role head movements play in the visual exploration of images and scenes. As the developer on this project,  I implemented and deployed our virtual reality environment on an Andriod smartphone using Unity and the Google Cardboard SDK. This research was conducted in Dr. Niebur's lab in the Mind/Brain Institute at the Johns Hopkins University.
                I learned about 3D math, VR design, data collection, and research experiment design

            <p>
                As an intern for the summer, I worked within a team of 5-6 software engineers on an agile-scrum team. My main responsibility was to address software defects critical to release. This included debugging C++ software/PHP extensions written in C++, conducting manual tests, and writing acceptance tests using PHP and FitNesse.
