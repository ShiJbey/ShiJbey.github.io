                I earned my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 and my Bachelor of Science from the University of Delaware with a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience.
                <br><br>
                I am interested in the creativity, world-building, and engineering process behind creating immersive and expressive video game experiences. Following this interest, I chose my university majors because I wanted to research and develop hardware that used trans-cranial stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to provide haptic feedback for virtual and mixed reality.
                <br><br>
                During my time at the Army Research Lab, I started working with EEG-based brain-computer interfaces. During my time in graduate school, I continued to work in this area, combining my EEG knowledge with my prior experience developing for virtual reality.
                <br><br>
                While at Carnegie Mellon, I learned more about concepts such as machine learning, probability theory, and computer vision. I also developed an interest in intelligent agents in video games research. Thus, I decided to transition into the field of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems following the completion of my masterâ€™s degree.
                <br><br>
                My educational experience has given me an essential understanding of software engineering principles such as algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and operating systems. It also provided me the opportunity to explore other areas like human cognition, sensation, perception, and physiology. All of which are drawn heavily upon when designing intelligent systems which interact with humans.

                <img id="audioErpScreenshot" src="./Assets/vr-screenshot.png" alt="audio erp screenshot">
                This was my masters research project. The goal was to explore the use of an auditory P300
                BCI paradigm for enabling users to select objects in virtual reality. What I ended with was
                an EEG-hardware agnostic Unity project that could be configured to run different P300 paradigms
                in virtual reality. The while runnning the unity scene EEG data is streamed from the headset
                and written out to files to be processed. For example, one is able to take recorded EEG data
                use a machine learning classifier to make predictions as to what object the user wants to select.
                Pictured is the virtual apartment environment with three objects used during testing.

                This was the final project for my Fall 2018 15-666: Computer Game Programming course. I worked with three
                other students and My primary role
                on this project was to write the code which imported our 3D assets,  built the level, and instanced
                characters/animations. In the game you play a Magpie bird who is stealing items from a museum.
                How many items can you steal before you're caught by security?

                <img id="mlBoxingScreenshot" src="./Assets/ml-boxing.gif" alt="Ml_boxing gif">
                I threw this project together over the course of a week as an entry in Unity's first challenge
                for their new 'Ml-Agents' machine learning workflow. I had tossed around the idea of
                using machine learning to train AI agents in fighting games, but I had never gotten around to it
                until then. The agents learn via Reinforcement Learning and are given a simple policy that
                positively rewards landed punches on the opponent, and negatively awards taking damage. Other
                behaviors such as successful blocking, and advancing on the opponent are rewarded as well.

                <img id="swordScreenshot" src="./Assets/sword-screenshot.png" alt="Sword Screenshot">
                Inspired by the then upcoming release of 'No Man's Sky' and my interest in blacksmithing,
                I tried my hand at developing a PCG system for swords. My goal was to finish the project
                and submit it to the Reddit PCG challenge linked below. This project served as an
                introduction to both PCG as well as computer graphics. The result is a NodeJs server that
                can export 3D meshes to Unity via a REST API. I am working on a HTML5 version that people
                can play on this site. The current version (see 'Infiniforge' tab above), is still much under
                construction.

                This is the first project from my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course. This was also my first
                group development project inwhich I worked with and another student. All groups were asked to produce
                a clone of the popular 'Plants vs. Zombies' game. This project as both a lesson in game development as well as
                a lesson in handling group dynamics. The game is written in Racket.

                This game clone was the final group project in  my Fall 2013 "CISC108: Intro to Computer Science I" course.
                Out of the cloning options, we chose to go with Battleship. The game is written using Racket and allows
                one player to play against an AI. Core lessons learned during the course of this project included,
                coordinating another student and programming GUIs in Racket.
